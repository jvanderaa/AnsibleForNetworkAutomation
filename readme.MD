# Ansible for Network Automation (2019)

This is where I will be posting more information and show notes type content. If
I mention a relevant link I will post it here. As I build out a little more
detail on each of the sessions, I will provide links for the individual page.  

[Ansible Docs](https://docs.ansible.com/)

## Ansible Installation Documents

The course was not meant to include how to install Ansible on your flavor of
system. I will instead provide a link to do so.
